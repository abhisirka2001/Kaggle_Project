# Problem statement
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a portion of the Multi-label Classification of enzyme substrates. This dataset only uses a subset of features from the original (the features that had the most signal). Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

 you are given 6 features in the training data, but only asked to predict the first two features (EC1 and EC2).
 
Files
train.csv - the training dataset; [EC1 - EC6] are the (binary) targets, although you are only asked to predict EC1 and EC2.
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of the two targets EC1 and EC2
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
